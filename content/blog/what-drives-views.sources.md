# Sources · AutoClip Research Note #1 (2026-10-09)

All metrics are **snapshots at fetch time** (UTC+8, 2026-10-09). They are copied from our working files and have not been re-fetched. X metrics are `impression_count` / `like_count` / `bookmark_count` / `media.view_count` as returned by X's read-only API. `view_count` merges views when a video is reused. YouTube metrics come from public pages read with `yt-dlp` (no cookies, proxy or login).

**URL note.** X URLs are copied exactly as recorded. For YouTube, our working files store video IDs. Batch 2 records links as `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/<id>`, so we built Shorts URLs the same way from the IDs in Batches 2–4. The two long videos use `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>`. Please spot-check these before publishing.

**Figures.** Case figures C1–C23 (`figures/case-*.jpg`) contain stills from third-party public posts, used for commentary and research with attribution (credits table at the end of this file). Charts (`figures/fig1–5,7-*-dark.png`; light variants without `-dark`) are generated from the numbers below by `src/charts.py`. Thumbnail overviews (`figures/fig11-r3-ab-pairs.jpg`, `figures/figA-*.jpg`) are stills from **our own renders** of three segments of a public interview: Dwarkesh Podcast, "Jensen Huang – Will Nvidia's moat persist?", 2026-04-15, 1080p taken from the publisher's public Substack post.

## Figure credits / References (case figures C1–C23)

Figures C1–C23 contain stills from third-party public posts, reproduced at reduced size for commentary and research, with attribution. All rights remain with the original owners. Every still was extracted on 2026-10-09 (UTC+8) from footage downloaded for this analysis on that day; no new footage was downloaded.
